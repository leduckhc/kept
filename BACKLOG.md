# Kept — Backlog

## Security / Dependency

- [ ] **glib 0.18 → 0.20 (CVE: unsound VariantStrIter)** — Moderate severity (6.9 CVSS v4). Transitive dep via `gtk 0.18 → libappindicator → tray-icon → tauri`. Not directly exploitable from our code (we never iterate GVariant strings). Blocked on Tauri bumping their tray-icon/gtk dep chain. Re-check when Tauri releases a major update.

## Features

- [ ] **Code signing + distribution** — Apple Developer ($99/yr) for macOS+iOS, Windows cert for SmartScreen, Android self-sign. Not needed until ready to distribute outside dev machine.
- [ ] **AI thread summaries + smart reply chips** — Local Ollama integration. Deferred until app is daily-driver stable.

- [ ] **Background send daemon** — OS-level sidecar (launchd/systemd/Task Scheduler) to dispatch scheduled sends when app is closed. Ship alongside code-signing/installer work.
- [ ] **E2E test suite** — Infrastructure ready; actual test files not written.

## UI / Layout

- [x] **Inbox section labels → Title Case** — ~~ALL-CAPS~~ → Title Capitalization. Done (84fb3fd).
- [ ] **Sender cards aligned with avatar on email threads** — The new sender cards must be visually aligned with the avatar in threaded email views.
- [x] **Right-align Compose button with Date/Time column** — Toolbar right padding now matches thread-row padding. Done (84fb3fd).
- [x] **New senders (first) card left-aligned with avatar** — Row padding now matches thread-row avatar alignment. Done (a50ebeb).
- [x] **Nav bar tooltips must appear to the right of the button, not below** — Sidebar tooltip rule now a standalone block after the generic tooltip system; no longer overridden. Done (a50ebeb).
- [x] **Arrow-key navigation overrides hover** — `.keyboard-nav` class added on arrow/j/k; removed on mousemove. Suppresses hover highlight when keyboard is active. Done (a50ebeb).
- [x] **Email sync must preserve current view** — `syncAndRender` and `refreshAll` now call `renderCurrentView()` which re-renders the active view (Drafts, Sent, etc.) instead of always resetting to Inbox. Done (af73eab).
- [x] **Bottom spacing on email list** — 40px bottom padding on .inbox. Done (84fb3fd).

## Tech Debt

- [x] **~300 lines dead CSS** — Removed `.btn-pill`, `.closing` animations, `fadeOut`/`slideDown` keyframes (60 lines net). Remaining classes all confirmed referenced. Done (ce1ca1e).
- [x] **Fragile 50ms setTimeout** — `openThreadWithReply` now awaits the render promise; search focus uses `requestAnimationFrame`. Done (ce1ca1e).
